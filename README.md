# sql-digital-media-trends

To apply my SQL skills in a realistic setting, I plan to work with a mock database like the Chinook dataset, which mirrors a digital media store. To simulate a real-world scenario, I will pose as an analyst being asked questions from a CEO. Iâ€™ll create and interpret query results into understandable insights and use tools like Tableau or Power BI for data visualization. This end-to-end process will mimic a real-world scenario, providing practical experience through a project that goes beyond online exercises.


The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.
